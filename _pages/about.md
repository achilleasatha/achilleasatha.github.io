## Machine Learning Engineer

Hi there 👋
I’m an MLE working at FLYR Hospitality. Trying to solve some of the tough challenges around demand and supply
forecasting in the hospitality industry.

### I’m passionate about:
- ML Engineering & ML Ops ☁️🚀
- Data engineering 🛠️
- Experimentation 🔬

### What I’m working on at the moment
Currently, I am working on demand and supply forecasting models for the hospitality industry. A large part of my focus
has been on cancellations predictions and how to best optimise occupancy and pricing to counter-balance their impact.

### Professional Experience
I have professional experience in experimentation (Frequentist & Bayesian), in multivariate (A/B/n) testing and
Multi-Armed Bandit experiments, with a strong focus on testing of ML solutions to understand and measure user-facing
impact.

I’ve been involved in developing and productionizing a large-scale experimentation platform on the cloud (twice!).

I've worked on domain-specific applications of computer vision for object detection & recognition and
building reinforcement learning agents to automate repetitive human tasks in IT.

### Volunteering
Additionally, I’ve been involved in pro-bono projects with UCL’s Analytics for Social Impact Society and UCL's
Consulting Society making analytics & data-science more accessible to charities and helping some early stage ventures.

One project involved market sizing through survival analysis for an aviation-related scale-up.

Another project involved deploying a cloud-based service to allow a charity to quickly summarize and classify
text documents.

### Teaching & Mentoring
I delivered the Data Analytics for Managers course at Product School for the 2019 cohort in London.

### Background
I have a background in Experimental High Energy Particle Physics, having spent some time doing research with groups
affiliated with DESY & CERN.

My professional experience has spanned many industries, from logistics, to travel & hospitality and software management.

I spend most of my free time chasing wind and waves 🏄 with my self-converted campervan 🚐, cross-training 🏋️ and doing
some lightweight amateur triathlon racing 🏊🚴🏃.
